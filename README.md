### More information

  Developing RESTful Web services that seamlessly support exposing your data in a variety of representation media types and abstract away the low-level details of the client-server communication is not an easy task without a good toolkit. In order to simplify development of RESTful Web services and their clients in Java, a standard and portable JAX-RS API has been designed. Jersey RESTful Web Services framework is open source, production quality, framework for developing RESTful Web Services in Java that provides support for JAX-RS APIs and serves as a JAX-RS (JSR 311 & JSR 339) Reference Implementation.

<br/><br/>
### HTTP Methods

The PUT, GET, POST and DELETE methods are typical used in REST based architectures. The following table gives an explanation of these operations.<br/><br/>

    GET defines a reading access of the resource without side-effects. The resource is never changed via a GET request, e.g., the request has no side effects (idempotent).<br/><br/>

    PUT creates a new resource. It must also be idempotent.<br/><br/>

    DELETE removes the resources. The operations are idempotent. They can get repeated without leading to different results.<br/><br/>

    POST updates an existing resource or creates a new resource.<br/><br/>

Here you can find a very interesting example of this restful service. <br/>
`GET request to https://{host}:{port}/sayHello`<br/>

```
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;

import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;

@Path("/")
public class WolfPackController extends Application{
		
        /**
         * Test request
         * @return string 
         */
        @GET
        @Path("/sayHello")
        public String getHelloMsg() throws Exception{
          return "Hello there!";
        }
}
```
<br/><br/>

  Jersey framework is more than the JAX-RS Reference Implementation. Jersey provides itâ€™s own API that extend the JAX-RS toolkit with additional features and utilities to further simplify RESTful service and client development. Jersey also exposes numerous extension SPIs so that developers may extend Jersey to best suit their needs.

<br/> <br/>
```
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

// Plain old Java Object it does not extend as class or implements
// an interface

// The class registers its methods for the HTTP GET request using the @GET annotation.
// Using the @Produces annotation, it defines that it can deliver several MIME types,
// text, XML and HTML.

// The browser requests per default the HTML MIME type.

//Sets the path to base URL + /hello
@Path("/hello")
public class Hello {

  // This method is called if TEXT_PLAIN is request
  @GET
  @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
  public String sayPlainTextHello() {
    return "Hello Jersey";
  }

  // This method is called if XML is request
  @GET
  @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_XML)
  public String sayXMLHello() {
    return "<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>" + "<hello> Hello Jersey" + "</hello>";
  }

  // This method is called if HTML is request
  @GET
  @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_HTML)
  public String sayHtmlHello() {
    return "<html> " + "<title>" + "Hello Jersey" + "</title>"
        + "<body><h1>" + "Hello Jersey" + "</body></h1>" + "</html> ";
  }

}

```
<br/><br/>


This class register itself as a get resource via the @GET annotation. Via the @Produces annotation it defines that it delivers the text and the HTML MIME types. It also defines via the @Path annotation that its service is available under the hello URL.
<br/>
The browser will always request the HTML MIME type. To see the text version, you can use tool like curl.
